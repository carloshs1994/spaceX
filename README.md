# SpaceX

> Inspired by the amazing company SpaceX, we built a mock website to showcase info about this company, like rockets and missions. It allows you to reserve rockets and a missions at will. You can then view all your reserved rockets and missions in your profile page. We built this website using *React* and *Redux* and we style it using *React Bootstrap*.

## Built With

- React, Redux, React Bootstrap
- Visual Studio Code.

## Live Demo

- [Live Demo Link github](https://carloshs1994.github.io/spaceX/)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

- Clone this repository with git clone```git@github.com:carloshs1994/spaceX.git``` using your terminal or command line.
- Change to the project directory by entering : <br>
```cd spaceX``` in the terminal

### Prerequisites

You need to make sure to have installed the latest version of Node.js and npm on your computer.
> To check run `node -v`, then `npm -v` and if you get a number it means you have them.

### Install

After clone it and before working on it, you have to run ```npm install``` so that all the dependencies of the project get downloaded in your pc locally.
Such dependencies include webpack and linters checks, for which you have to either generate your own config file or get one. 

Note: If you're a Microverse's Student, you should use the config files provided by the program.
[Linters Config React-Redux](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config/tree/master/react-redux)  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
